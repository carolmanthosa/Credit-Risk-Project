# 📌 Credit Risk Prediction
 🔎 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict credit risk and identify factors that influence loan default. Financial institutions face significant challenges in distinguishing between reliable borrowers and those at higher risk of default. By leveraging predictive modeling, banks can make more informed lending decisions, reduce financial losses, and improve customer targeting strategies.

⚙️ Methodology

Dataset: Borrower demographic and financial information.

Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized features, and managed class imbalance.

Feature Selection: Considered factors such as loan interest rate, borrower’s income, income-to-loan ratio, loan grade, home ownership status, employment length, and loan amount.

- Models Applied:

- Random Forest

- Bagging

- XGBoost

- Decision Tree

- Extra Trees

- AdaBoost

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

 📊 Results & Findings

Random Forest and Bagging emerged as the best-performing models, achieving high accuracy, precision, F1-score, and AUC.

XGBoost also performed exceptionally well, with a strong AUC score indicating excellent discrimination ability between classes.

Key predictive features include:

- Loan interest rate

- Borrower’s income

- Income-to-loan ratio

- Loan grade

- Home ownership status (mortgage/rent)

- Employment length

- Loan amount

 ✅ Conclusion

The study demonstrated that ensemble models such as Random Forest, Bagging, and XGBoost are highly effective for credit risk prediction. These models capture complex patterns in borrower data, making them suitable for deployment in real-world banking scenarios.

# 💡 Recommendations

Banks should adopt Random Forest, Bagging, or XGBoost models for evaluating loan applicants due to their high predictive accuracy and ability to handle imbalanced datasets.

Pay close attention to loan interest rate, borrower’s income, and income-to-loan ratio, as they are strong indicators of default risk.

Offer competitive interest rates to low-risk borrowers while applying stricter screening measures for high-interest loan applicants.

Consider the borrower’s employment stability and home ownership status, as shorter employment history and renting/mortgage status are linked to higher default risk.
